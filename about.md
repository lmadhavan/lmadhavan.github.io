My name is Madhavan Lakshminarayanan. I'm a software engineer by profession, but I've also been tinkering with my own little software projects for over 20 years. I believe in simple software that just does the job, as opposed to [bloated software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bloat) that many commercial applications have come to be.

**A bit of history...**

I originally started this website back in 2004 as a simple page to share my software projects with the world. It was hosted on [GeoCities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities) and titled [Madhavan's Software Page](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.geocities.com/casablanca2000in/msp/).

My first application that received [a bit of attention](https://web.archive.org/web/20050125025950/http://channels.lockergnome.com/windows/archives/20050120_snowbird_search.phtml) was a file search tool called Snowbird, which performed better than the built-in search tool in Windows XP at the time, especially for finding text inside files. Fun fact: Snowbird was only 20 KB in size, but my website would go down frequently because GeoCities had an hourly bandwidth limit of about 4 MB.

GeoCities eventually shut down in 2009, which is when I moved the website to my current domain. That was also the year I released an image editor called [Fotografix](/fotografix/) which has since been my most downloaded application. Most of my older software is no longer relevant these days, but I continue to actively maintain Fotografix.
