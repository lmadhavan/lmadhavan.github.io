I recently started playing with Microsoft's [Universal Windows Platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Windows_Platform), which lets developers write a single app that works across all form factors (mobile and PC right now, Xbox and HoloLens in the near future). Obviously something like [Fotografix](/fotografix/) doesn't make much sense on a phone (at least not yet) and not everyone has upgraded their desktops to Windows 10, so I set out to build something simple.

League Handbook is pretty mundane as far as apps go, but possibly useful if you play [League of Legends](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/) and have a device that runs Windows 10. It's a digital reference book for the game that lets you look up details about champions and items. And that's about it.
