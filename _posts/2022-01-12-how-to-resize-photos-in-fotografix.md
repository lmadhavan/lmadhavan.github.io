Here's how to batch resize photos in Fotografix:

1. Open Fotografix and select the folder containing your photos.

2. Select the photos that you want to resize. You can select individual photos by holding down the `Ctrl` key, or a range of photos by holding down the `Shift` key.

3. Click **Export** to open the export dialog.

4. Check the **Resize output** box and enter the maximum output dimension in pixels. Fotografix will automatically maintain the original aspect ratio of the photo when resizing.

5. *(Optional)* Adjust the **Quality** slider to change the output quality. A lower value will reduce file size at the cost of image quality.

5. Click **Export** to begin the batch export process.
