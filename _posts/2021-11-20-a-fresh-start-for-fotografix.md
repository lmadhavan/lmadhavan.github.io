When I started working on Fotografix in 2008, I envisioned it to be primarily a tool for photo editing. Although the original release included basic drawing and composition tools, these were ancillary to its core function and never sophisticated enough to be useful to other audiences such as artists or designers.

Today, I am happy to announce a brand new version of Fotografix that better aligns with that original vision and focuses exclusively on providing a seamless photo editing experience. You can [try the beta right now](/fotografix/): it's far from complete but it should already feel like an upgrade to the old version for photo editing. On the flip side, this means that Fotografix no longer serves as a general-purpose image editor, however there are plenty of other options out there to fill that gap.
